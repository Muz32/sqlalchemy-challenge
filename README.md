# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this assignemnt challenge I use sql alchemy to connect to a sqlite database on climate data to undertake various analysis. I also designed a flask API to return various quiries from the sqlite database. This assignment challenge is divided into two parts:

## Part 1 Analysing and Exploring the Climate Data
I analysed weather data for precipitation (prcp) and temperature observations (tobs) for different stations. The analysis included converting queried results from the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to pandas dataframes and plotting of results. The analysis in this part was done using jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook file is contained in the folder'Surfsup'with the file name 'climate.ipynb'. 

## Part 2 Part 2: Design Your Climate App


##Source of data
